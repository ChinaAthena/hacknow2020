## Ideas
1. helping local business: a website that can help argue lower the rent of small retail business by automatically calculate their financial needs
### Details:
we currently have a plan about a website that automatically build reliable new rent plans for the retail renter and rentee, based on the financial detail the rentee entered.
The idea is that current local retail business may not have enough cash under current plummet of their sale business to pay their rent, and the rent is the dominant fixed cost of retail business.
On the other hand, it’s also bad for the renter if the retail store ends up bankrupcy/shut-down, and should be likely to offer a lower rate, or extend the payment date, etc… to help those retail rentee.
The website we build would allow the retail business owner to enter in the financial information of the store, and automatically generate the rent plans for the retail business owner to sustain, and would allow the renter and rentee to make an agreement based on that.
we hope it will be a win-win for renter and rentee so they together can go through this hard time.
